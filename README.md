## Technologies Used

In this project I used libraries like **Zod** and **Redux**(framework).They are not necessary or indispensable for this app, I chose to include them because I will need them in another project I'm working on and i wanted to make practice.
Global state between pages could be managed with a context or different custom hook if preferred.
Even folders structures is overcomplicated but used just to take confidence with a new structure i want to start using from now on.

This project serves as a practice ground for getting more comfortable with these tools cause i think is a good to use different technologies and algorithm idea first in a more controlled and simple environment before switching to more complex logic or with more connections

I there are any improvements that could be done i am open to advice and opinions
